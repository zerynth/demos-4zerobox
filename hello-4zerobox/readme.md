Hello World
===========
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to get the 4ZeroBox up and running starting with the famous Hello Zerynth example.

In this example, we will be using:

Zerynth OS - a multithreaded Real-Time OS that provides real hardware independence, allowing code reuse on a wide range of 32-bit microcontrollers, in a very small footprint;
Zerynth SDK - the gateway to our platform which includes:

Zerynth Toolchain – a command-line interface that integrates all the essential functions for the development with Zerynth OS  and the management of the Zerynth Device Manager cloud service.
Zerynth Studio – an advanced IDE for the Zerynth Toolchain. It includes development and debugging tools and numerous code examples.

4ZeroBox - a modular hardware electronic unit that simplifies the development of Industrial IoT applications allowing rapid integration with sensors, actuators, and Cloud services. 4ZeroBox is programmable in Python (or hybrid C/Python) thanks to the Zerynth SDK.
